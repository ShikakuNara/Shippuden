# MATLAB ASSIGNMENT
## REGRESSION  MODEL

This program aims to use polynomial regression models from degree  one to four to explain the given data set and  compare them.
The input are the X and Y coordinates of the data set or namely the observations. 
The output contains the coeffecients of all the four regression polynomials, their regression coeffecients and a figure containing 
a scatter plot of the given data set along with the graphs of all four polynomials.

## Bairstow Method

This Program aims at using Bairstow method to compute the roots of a given nth degree polynomial in single variable x.
The input contains the polynomial's degree and the corresponding coeffecients.
The output contains all the roots (real and complex) and a  graph of the given polynomial.
