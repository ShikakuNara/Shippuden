##REGRESSION  MODEL

This program aims to use polynomial regression models from degree  one to four to explain the given data set and  compare them.
The input are the X and Y coordinates of the data set or namely the observations.
The output contains the coeffecients of all the four regression polynomials, their regression coeffecients and a figure containing 
a scatter plot of the given data set along with the graphs of all four polynomials.
