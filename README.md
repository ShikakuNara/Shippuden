# MATLAB ASSIGNMENT
## REGRESSION  MODEL

This program aims to use polynomial regression models from degree  one to four to explain the given data set and  compare them.
The input are the X and Y coordinates of the data set or namely the observations. 
The output contains the coeffecients of all the four regression polynomials, their regression coeffecients and a figure containing 
a scatter plot of the given data set along with the graphs of all four polynomials, to compare the four methods graphically.

## Bairstow Method Implementation

This Program aims at using Bairstow method to compute the roots of a given nth degree polynomial in single variable x.
The input contains the polynomial's degree and the corresponding coeffecients.
The output contains all the roots (real and complex) and a  graph of the given polynomial.

## Gauss-Seidel Method Implementation

The program implements gauss-seidel method with relaxation to solve linear euations in n variables. The coeffecients are taken as input as an nXn matrix along with the constants, and a system of n equation of the form a1x1 + a2x2 + a3x3 ..... anxn + c=0 and approximates the values to a certain accepted value of error taken as input. 

## Integration of a particular 2nd order differential Equation via Implementing Euler's Method - Heun's Method - 4th Order Runge-Kutta Method.

The program implements Euler's method , Heun's Method and Fourth Order Runge-Kutta method to solve a predefined 2nd order Differential Equation by decomposing the equation into a system of two 1st order Differential equations.
